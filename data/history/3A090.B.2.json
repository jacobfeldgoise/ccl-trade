'Total processing performance' ('TPP') is 2 × 'MacTOPS' × 'bit length of the operation', aggregated over all processing units on the integrated circuit. a. For purposes of 3A090, 'MacTOPS' is the theoretical peak number of Tera (10 12) operations per second for multiply-accumulate computation (D = A × B + C). b. The 2 in the 'TPP' formula is based on industry convention of counting one multiply-accumulate computation, D = A × B + C, as 2 operations for purpose of datasheets. Therefore, 2 × MacTOPS may correspond to the reported TOPS or FLOPS on a datasheet. c. For purposes of 3A090, 'bit length of the operation' for a multiply-accumulate computation is the largest bit-length of the inputs to the multiply operation. d. Aggregate the TPPs for each processing unit on the integrated circuit to arrive at a total. 'TPP' = TPP1 + TPP2 + . . . . + TPPn (where n is the number or processing units on the integrated circuit). 2. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is assumed to be the highest value the manufacturer claims in annual or brochure for the integrated circuit. For example, the 'TPP' threshold of 4800 can be met with 600 tera integer operations (or 2 × 300 'MacTOPS') at 8 bits or 300 tera FLOPS (or 2 × 150 'MacTOPS') at 16 bits. If the IC is designed for MAC computation with multiple bit lengths that achieve different 'TPP' values, the highest 'TPP' value should be evaluated against parameters in 3A090. 3. For integrated circuits specified by 3A090 that provide processing of both sparse and dense matrices, the 'TPP' values are the values for processing of dense matrices (e.g., without sparsity). 4. 'Performance density' is 'TPP' divided by 'applicable die area'. For purposes of 3A090, 'applicable die area' is measured in millimeters squared and includes all die area of logic dies manufactured with a process node that uses a non-planar transistor architecture.",

'Total processing performance' ('TPP') is 2 × 'MacTOPS' × 'bit length of the operation', aggregated over all processing units on the integrated circuit. a. For purposes of 3A090, `MacTOPS' is the theoretical peak number of Tera (10 12) operations per second for multiply-accumulate computation (D = A × B + C). b. The 2 in the 'TPP' formula is based on industry convention of counting one multiply-accumulate computation, D = A × B + C, as 2 operations for purpose of datasheets. Therefore, 2 × MacTOPS may correspond to the reported TOPS or FLOPS on a datasheet. c. For purposes of 3A090, 'bit length of the operation' for a multiply-accumulate computation is the largest bit-length of the inputs to the multiply operation. d. Aggregate the TPPs for each processing unit on the integrated circuit to arrive at a total. 'TPP' = TPP1 + TPP2 + . . . . + TPPn (where n is the number or processing units on the integrated circuit). 2. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is assumed to be the highest value the manufacturer claims in annual or brochure for the integrated circuit. For example, the 'TPP' threshold of 4800 can be met with 600 tera integer operations (or 2 × 300 'MacTOPS') at 8 bits or 300 tera FLOPS (or 2 × 150 'MacTOPS') at 16 bits. If the IC is designed for MAC computation with multiple bit lengths that achieve different 'TPP' values, the highest 'TPP' value should be evaluated against parameters in 3A090. 3. For integrated circuits specified by 3A090 that provide processing of both sparse and dense matrices, the 'TPP' values are the values for processing of dense matrices (e.g., without sparsity). 4. 'Performance density' is 'TPP' divided by 'applicable die area'. For purposes of 3A090, 'applicable die area' is measured in millimeters squared and includes all die area of logic dies manufactured with a process node that uses a non-planar transistor architecture.",

'Total processing performance' ('TPP') is 2 × 'MacTOPS' × 'bit length of the operation', aggregated over all processing units on the integrated circuit. a. For purposes of 3A090, 'MacTOPS' is the theoretical peak number of Tera (10 12) operations per second for multiply-accumulate computation (D = A × B + C). b. The 2 in the 'TPP' formula is based on industry convention of counting one multiply-accumulate computation, D = A × B + C, as 2 operations for purpose of datasheets. Therefore, 2 × MacTOPS may correspond to the reported TOPS or FLOPS on a datasheet. c. For purposes of 3A090, 'bit length of the operation' for a multiply-accumulate computation is the largest bit-length of the inputs to the multiply operation. d. Aggregate the TPPs for each processing unit on the integrated circuit to arrive at a total. 'TPP' = TPP1 + TPP2 + . . . . + TPPn (where n is the number or processing units on the integrated circuit). 2. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible. The rate of 'MacTOPS' is assumed to be the highest value the manufacturer claims in annual or brochure for the integrated circuit. For example, the 'TPP' threshold of 4800 can be met with 600 tera integer operations (or 2 × 300 'MacTOPS') at 8 bits or 300 tera FLOPS (or 2 × 150 'MacTOPS') at 16 bits. If the integrated circuit (IC) is designed for MAC computation with multiple bit lengths that achieve different 'TPP' values, the highest 'TPP' value should be evaluated against parameters in 3A090. 3. For integrated circuits specified by 3A090 that provide processing of both sparse and dense matrices, the 'TPP' values are the values for processing of dense matrices (e.g., without sparsity). 4. 'Performance density' is 'TPP' divided by 'applicable die area'. For purposes of 3A090, 'applicable die area' is measured in millimeters squared and includes all die area of logic dies manufactured with a process node that uses a non-planar transistor architecture.",
