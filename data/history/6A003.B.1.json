For the purpose of this entry, 'camera tracking data' is the information necessary to define camera line of sight orientation with respect to the earth. This includes: (1) The horizontal angle the camera line of sight makes with respect to the earth's magnetic field direction and; (2) the vertical angle between the camera line of sight and the earth's horizon.",

For the purpose of this entry, 'camera tracking data' is the information necessary to define camera line of sight orientation with respect to the earth. This includes: (1) the horizontal angle the camera line of sight makes with respect to the earth's magnetic field direction and; (2) the vertical angle between the camera line of sight and the earth's horizon.",
