A resolution of n bit corresponds to a quantization of 2 n levels. 2. The resolution of the ADC is the number of bits of the digital output of the ADC that represents the measured analog input. Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) is not used to determine the resolution of the ADC. 3. For integrated circuits with non-interleaving “multiple channel ADCs”, the “sample rate” is not aggregated and the “sample rate” is the maximum rate of any single channel. 4. For integrated circuits with “interleaved ADCs” or with “multiple channel ADCs” that are specified to have an interleaved mode of operation, the “sample rates” are aggregated and the “sample rate” is the maximum combined total rate of all of the interleaved channels.",
