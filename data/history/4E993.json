For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote: In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions and/or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero.\n2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor.\nR\ni\n= FPO\ni\n/t\ni\n.\n3. Calculate “APP” as\n“APP” = W\n1\n× R\n1\n+ W\n2\n× R\n2\n+ * * * + W\nn\n× R\nn\n.\n4. For ‘vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-‘vector processors’, Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations (inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory\nTechnical Notes: 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A ‘vector processor’ is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.",

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote: In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions and/or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero.\n2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor.\nR\ni\n= FPO\ni\n/t\ni\n.\n3. Calculate “APP” as\n“APP” = W\n1\n× R\n1\n+ W\n2\n× R\n2\n+ * * * + W\nn\n× R\nn\n.\n4. For ‘vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-‘vector processors’, Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations (inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory\nTechnical Notes: 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A ‘vector processor’ is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote: In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions and/or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero.\n2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor.\nR\ni\n= FPO\ni\n/t\ni\n.\n3. Calculate “APP” as\n“APP” = W\n1\n× R\n1\n+ W\n2\n× R\n2\n+ * * * + W\nn\n× R\nn\n.\n4. For ‘vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-‘vector processors’, Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations (inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory\nTechnical Notes: 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2.

Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations (inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory\nTechnical Notes: 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A ‘vector processor’ is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.",

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote: In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions and/or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero.\n2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor.\nR\ni\n= FPO\ni\n/t\ni\n.\n3. Calculate “APP” as\n“APP” = W\n1\n× R\n1\n+ W\n2\n× R\n2\n+ * * * + W\nn\n× R\nn\n.\n4. For ‘vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-‘vector processors’, Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations (inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory\nTechnical Notes: 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A ‘vector processor’ is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.",

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1.

Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1.

Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.",

Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2.

For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1.

For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.",

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9.

Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.\n3. Commodities in ECCN 5A001.j, and related “software” specified in 5D001.c (for 5A001.j) that are also controlled in ECCNs 5A002.a, 5A004.a, 5A004.b, 5D002.c.1, or 5D002.c.3, remain controlled in Category 5 - Part 2 by those entries. Category 5 - Part 2 does not apply to elements of source code that implement functionality controlled by these Category 5 Part 1 ECCNs, or to any item subject to the EAR where Encryption Item (EI) functionality is absent, removed or otherwise non-existent.\n4.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.\n3.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.\n3.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, 4A003.z.1, 4A003.z.3.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, 4A003.z.1, 4A003.z.3.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.\n3.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, 4A003.z.1, 4A003.z.3.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.\n3.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, 4A003.z.1, 4A003.z.3.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, 4A003.z.1, 4A003.z.3.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1.

For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, 4A003.z.1, 4A003.z.3.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.\n3. Commodities in ECCN 5A001.j, and related “software” specified in 5D001.c (for 5A001.j) that are also controlled in ECCNs 5A002.a, 5A002.z.1, 5A002.z.6, 5A004.a, 5A004.b, 5A004.z, 5D002.c.1, 5D002.c.3, 5D002.z.6, 5D002.z.8, 5D002.z 5D002.z.9, remain controlled in Category 5—Part 2 by those entries. Category 5—Part 2 does not apply to elements of source code that implement functionality controlled by these Category 5 Part 1 ECCNs, or to any item subject to the EAR where Encryption Item (EI) functionality is absent, removed or otherwise non-existent.\n4. Items in ECCN 5A001.j, 5B001.a (for 5A001.j), related “software” specified in 5D001.a (for 5A001.j) and 5D001.c (for 5A001.j or 5B001.a (for 5A001.j)) and related “technology” specified in ECCN 5E001.a (for 5A001.j and 5D001.a (for 5A001.j)) that are also controlled for Surreptitious Listening (SL) reasons under another ECCN, will continue to be classified under the SL ECCN.",

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, 4A003.z.1, 4A003.z.3.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.\n3.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, 4A003.z.1, 4A003.z.3.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.\n3.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2. Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, 4A003.z.1, 4A003.z.3.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1.

For each processor i, determine the peak number of 64-bit or larger floating-point operations, FPOi, performed per cycle for each processor in the “digital computer”.\nNote In determining FPO, include only 64-bit or larger floating point additions or multiplications. All floating point operations must be expressed in operations per processor cycle; operations requiring multiple cycles may be expressed in fractional results per cycle. For processors not capable of performing calculations on floating-point operands of 64-bits or more the effective calculating rate R is zero. 2. Calculate the floating point rate R for each processor Ri = FPOi/ti. 3. Calculate “APP” as “APP” = W1 × R1 + W2 × R2 + . . . + Wn × Rn. 4. For 'vector processors', Wi = 0.9. For non-'vector processors', Wi = 0.3.\nNote 1: For processors that perform compound operations in a cycle, such as an addition and multiplication, each operation is counted.\nNote 2: For a pipelined processor the effective calculating rate R is the faster of the pipelined rate, once the pipeline is full, or the non-pipelined rate.\nNote 3: The calculating rate R of each contributing processor is to be calculated at its maximum value theoretically possible before the “APP” of the combination is derived. Simultaneous operations are assumed to exist when the computer manufacturer claims concurrent, parallel, or simultaneous operation or execution in a manual or brochure for the computer.\nNote 4: Do not include processors that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display) when calculating “APP”.\nNote 5: “APP” values are not to be calculated for processor combinations(inter)connected by “Local Area Networks”, Wide Area Networks, I/O shared connections/devices, I/O controllers and any communication interconnection implemented by “software”.\nNote 6: “APP” values must be calculated for processor combinations containing processors “specially designed” to enhance performance by aggregation, operating simultaneously and sharing memory.\nTechnical Notes 1. Aggregate all processors and accelerators operating simultaneously and located on the same die. 2.

Processor combinations share memory when any processor is capable of accessing any memory location in the system through the hardware transmission of cache lines or memory words, without the involvement of any software mechanism, which may be achieved using “electronic assemblies” specified in 4A003.c, 4A003.z.1, 4A003.z.3.\nNote 7: A 'vector processor' is defined as a processor with built-in instructions that perform multiple calculations on floating-point vectors (one-dimensional arrays of 64-bit or larger numbers) simultaneously, having at least 2 vector functional units and at least 8 vector registers of at least 64 elements each.\nNotes: 1. The control status of “components”, test and “production” equipment, and “software” therefor which are “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems is determined in Category 5, Part 1.\nN.B.: For “lasers” “specially designed” for telecommunications equipment or systems, see ECCN 6A005.\n2. “Digital computers”, related equipment or “software”, when essential for the operation and support of telecommunications equipment described in this Category, are regarded as “specially designed” “components”, provided they are the standard models customarily supplied by the manufacturer. This includes operation, administration, maintenance, engineering or billing computer systems.\n3. Commodities in ECCN 5A001.j, and related “software” specified in 5D001.c (for 5A001.j) that are also controlled in ECCNs 5A002.a, 5A002.z.1, 5A002.z.6, 5A004.a, 5A004.b, 5A004.z, 5D002.c.1, 5D002.c.3, 5D002.z.6, 5D002.z.8, 5D002.z 5D002.z.9, remain controlled in Category 5—Part 2 by those entries. Category 5—Part 2 does not apply to elements of source code that implement functionality controlled by these Category 5 Part 1 ECCNs, or to any item subject to the EAR where Encryption Item (EI) functionality is absent, removed or otherwise non-existent.\n4. Items in ECCN 5A001.j, 5B001.a (for 5A001.j), related “software” specified in 5D001.a (for 5A001.j) and 5D001.c (for 5A001.j or 5B001.a (for 5A001.j)) and related “technology” specified in ECCN 5E001.a (for 5A001.j and 5D001.a (for 5A001.j)) that are also controlled for Surreptitious Listening (SL) reasons under another ECCN, will continue to be classified under the SL ECCN.",
