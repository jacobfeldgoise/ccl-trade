A resolution of n bit corresponds to a quantization of 2 n levels. 2.

Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) is not used to determine the resolution of the ADC. 3. For non-interleaved multiple-channel “electronic assemblies”, modules, or equipment, the “sample rate” is not aggregated and the “sample rate” is the maximum rate of any single channel. 4. For interleaved channels on multiple-channel “electronic assemblies”, modules, or equipment, the “sample rates” are aggregated and the “sample rate” is the maximum combined total rate of all the interleaved channels.\nNote: 3A002.h includes ADC cards, waveform digitizers, data acquisition cards, signal acquisition boards and transient recorders.",

The resolution of the ADC is the number of bits in of the digital output of the ADC that represents the measured analog input word. Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) is not used to determine the resolution of the ADC. 3. For non-interleaved multiple-channel “electronic assemblies”, modules, or equipment, the “sample rate” is not aggregated and the “sample rate” is the maximum rate of any single channel. 4. For interleaved channels on multiple-channel “electronic assemblies”, modules, or equipment, the “sample rates” are aggregated and the “sample rate” is the maximum combined total rate of all the interleaved channels.",

For interleaved channels on multiple-channel “electronic assemblies”, modules, or equipment, the “sample rates” are aggregated and the “sample rate” is the maximum combined total rate of all the interleaved channels.\nNote: 3A002.h includes ADC cards, waveform digitizers, data acquisition cards, signal acquisition boards and transient recorders.",

Effective Number of Bits (ENOB) is not used to determine the resolution of the ADC. 3. For non-interleaved multiple-channel “electronic assemblies”, modules, or equipment, the “sample rate” is not aggregated and the “sample rate” is the maximum rate of any single channel. 4. For interleaved channels on multiple-channel “electronic assemblies”, modules, or equipment, the “sample rates” are aggregated and the “sample rate” is the maximum combined total rate of all the interleaved channels.\nNote: 3A002.h includes ADC cards, waveform digitizers, data acquisition cards, signal acquisition boards and transient recorders.",
