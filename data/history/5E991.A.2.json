Over-the-counter transactions; b. Mail order transactions; c. Electronic transactions; or d. Telephone call transactions; 2. The cryptographic functionality cannot be easily changed by the user; 3. Designed for installation by the user without further substantial support by the supplier; and 4.

To meet paragraph a. of Note 3, all of the following must apply: a. The item is of potential interest to a wide range of individuals and businesses; and b. The price and information about the main functionality of the item are available before purchase without the need to consult the vendor or supplier. A simple price inquiry is not considered to be a consultation. 2.

The price and information about the main functionality of the item are available before purchase without the need to consult the vendor or supplier. A simple price inquiry is not considered to be a consultation. 2. In determining eligibility of paragraph a. of Note 3, BIS may take into account relevant factors such as quantity, price, required technical skill, existing sales channels, typical customers, typical use or any exclusionary practices of the supplier.\nN.B. to Note 3 (Cryptography Note): You must submit a classification request or self-classification report to BIS for certain mass market encryption commodities and software eligible for the Cryptography Note employing a key length greater than 64 bits for the symmetric algorithm (or, for commodities and software not implementing any symmetric algorithms, employing a key length greater than 768 bits for asymmetric algorithms described by Technical note 2.b to 5A002.a or greater than 128 bits for elliptic curve algorithms, or any asymmetric algorithm described by Technical Note 2.c to 5A002.a) in accordance with the requirements of § 740.17(b) of the EAR in order to be released from the “EI” and “NS” controls of ECCN 5A002 or 5D002. For mass market commodities and software that do not require a self-classification report pursuant to § 740.17(b) and (e)(3) of the EAR, such items are also released from “EI” and “NS” controls and controlled under ECCN 5A992 or 5D992.",
