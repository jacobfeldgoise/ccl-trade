Item 9B106.a.2 describes systems that are capable of generating a vibration environment with a single wave (e.g., a sine wave) and systems capable of generating a broad band random vibration (i.e., power spectrum). 2. The term ‘bare table’ means a flat table, or surface, with no fixture or fittings. 3. In Item 9B106.a.2, designed or modified means the environmental chamber provides appropriate interfaces (e.g., sealing devices) to incorporate a shaker unit or other vibration test equipment as specified in this Item.\nEnvironmental chambers capable of simulating all of the following flight conditions:\nb. Environmental chambers capable of simulating all of the following flight conditions:\nAcoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 × 10−5 N/m 2) or with a total rated acoustic power output of 4kW or greater; and\nb.1. Acoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 × 10−5 N/m 2) or with a total rated acoustic power output of 4kW or greater; and\nAny of the following:\nb.2. Any of the following:\nAltitude equal to or greater than 15,000 m; or\nb.2.a. Altitude equal to or greater than 15,000 m; or\nTemperature range of at least −50 °C to + 125 °C.\nb.2.b.

In Item 9B106.a.2, designed or modified means the environmental chamber provides appropriate interfaces (e.g., sealing devices) to incorporate a shaker unit or other vibration test equipment as specified in this Item.\nEnvironmental chambers capable of simulating all of the following flight conditions:\nb. Environmental chambers capable of simulating all of the following flight conditions:\nAcoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 × 10−5 N/m 2) or with a total rated acoustic power output of 4kW or greater; and\nb.1. Acoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 × 10−5 N/m 2) or with a total rated acoustic power output of 4kW or greater; and\nAny of the following:\nb.2. Any of the following:\nAltitude equal to or greater than 15,000 m; or\nb.2.a. Altitude equal to or greater than 15,000 m; or\nTemperature range of at least −50 °C to + 125 °C.\nb.2.b. Temperature range of at least −50 °C to + 125 °C.",

Environmental chambers capable of simulating all of the following flight conditions:\nAcoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 × 10−5 N/m 2) or with a total rated acoustic power output of 4kW or greater; and\nb.1. Acoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 × 10−5 N/m 2) or with a total rated acoustic power output of 4kW or greater; and\nAny of the following:\nb.2. Any of the following:\nAltitude equal to or greater than 15,000 m; or\nb.2.a. Altitude equal to or greater than 15,000 m; or\nTemperature range of at least −50 °C to + 125 °C.\nb.2.b. Temperature range of at least −50 °C to + 125 °C.",

In Item 9B106.a.2, designed or modified means the environmental chamber provides appropriate interfaces (e.g., sealing devices) to incorporate a shaker unit or other vibration test equipment as specified in this Item.\nEnvironmental chambers capable of simulating all of the following flight conditions:\nb. Environmental chambers capable of simulating all of the following flight conditions:\nAcoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 × 10−5 N/m 2) or with a total rated acoustic power output of 4kW or greater; and\nb.1. Acoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 × 10−5 N/m 2) or with a total rated acoustic power output of 4kW or greater; and\nAny of the following:\nb.2. Any of the following:\nAltitude equal to or greater than 15,000 m; or\nb.2.a. Altitude equal to or greater than 15,000 m; or\nTemperature range of at least −50 °C to + 125 °C.\nb.2.b. Temperature range of at least −50 °C to + 125 °C.",

In Item 9B106.a.2, designed or modified means the environmental chamber provides appropriate interfaces (e.g., sealing devices) to incorporate a shaker unit or other vibration test equipment as specified in this Item.\nEnvironmental chambers capable of simulating all of the following flight conditions:\nb. Environmental chambers capable of simulating all of the following flight conditions:\nAcoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 × 10−5 N/m 2) or with a total rated acoustic power output of 4kW or greater; and\nb.1. Acoustic environments at an overall sound pressure level of 140 dB or greater (referenced to 2 × 10−5 N/m 2) or with a total rated acoustic power output of 4kW or greater; and\nAny of the following:\nb.2. Any of the following:\nAltitude equal to or greater than 15,000 m; or\nb.2.a. Altitude equal to or greater than 15,000 m; or\nTemperature range of at least −50 °C to + 125 °C.\nb.2.b. Temperature range of at least −50 °C to + 125 °C.",
