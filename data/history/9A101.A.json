Specific fuel consumption is determined at maximum continuous thrust for engine type un-installed at sea level static conditions using the ICAO standard atmosphere. 3. 'Dry weight' is the weight of the engine without fluids (fuel, hydraulic fluid, oil, etc.) and does not include the nacelle (housing). 4. 'First-stage rotor diameter' is the diameter of the first rotating stage of the engine, whether a fan or compressor, measured at the leading edge of the blade tips.",
