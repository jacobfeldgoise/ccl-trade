(See part 742 of the EAR for additional information on the AT controls that apply to Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. See part 746 of the EAR for additional information on sanctions that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria.)\nLicense Requirement Notes 1. Sample Shipments: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons. a. Chemicals Not Eligible: A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. Mixtures: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. Compounds. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. Testing Kits: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.7 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a description of all license exceptions)\nLVS:\nN/A\nGBS:\nN/A\nCIV:\nN/A\nList of Items Controlled\nRelated Controls:\nSee USML Category XIV(c) for related chemicals “subject to the ITAR” (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).\nRelated Definitions:\nSee § 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonyms for the chemicals listed in this entry.\nItems:\na.

The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. Mixtures: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. Compounds. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. Testing Kits: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.7 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a description of all license exceptions)\nLVS:\nN/A\nGBS:\nN/A\nCIV:\nN/A\nList of Items Controlled\nRelated Controls:\nSee USML Category XIV(c) for related chemicals “subject to the ITAR” (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).\nRelated Definitions:\nSee § 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonyms for the chemicals listed in this entry.\nItems:\na.

A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons. a. Chemicals Not Eligible: A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW., Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. Mixtures: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.",

Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. Testing Kits: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.) Technical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.7 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.",

Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.",

See part 746 of the EAR for additional information on sanctions that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria.)\nLicense Requirement Notes: 1. Sample Shipments: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons. a. Chemicals Not Eligible: A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. Mixtures: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. Compounds. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. Testing Kits: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3.

Chemicals Not Eligible: A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. Mixtures: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. Compounds. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. Testing Kits: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a Description of All License Exceptions)\nLVS:\nN/A\nGBS:\nN/A\nList of Items Controlled\nRelated Controls:\nSee USML Category XIV(c) for related chemicals “subject to the ITAR” (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).\nRelated Definitions:\nSee § 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonyms for the chemicals listed in this entry.\nItems:\na.

Sample Shipments: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons. a. Chemicals Not Eligible: A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. Mixtures: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. Compounds. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. Testing Kits: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable).

Sample Shipments: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons. a. Chemicals Not Eligible: A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. Mixtures: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. Compounds. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. Testing Kits: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number.

(See part 742 of the EAR for additional information on the AT controls that apply to Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. See part 746 of the EAR for additional information on sanctions that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria.)\nLicense Requirement Notes: 1. Sample Shipments: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons. a. Chemicals Not Eligible: A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. Mixtures: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. Compounds. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. Testing Kits: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a Description of All License Exceptions)\nLVS:\nN/A\nGBS:\nN/A\nList of Items Controlled\nRelated Controls:\nSee USML Category XIV(c) for related chemicals “subject to the ITAR” (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).\nRelated Definitions:\nSee § 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonyms for the chemicals listed in this entry.\nItems:\na.

A license is required, for AT reasons, to export or reexport items controlled by 1C350, 1C350.a country in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR. (See part 742 of the EAR for additional information on the AT controls that apply to Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria. See part 746 of the EAR for additional information on sanctions that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria.)\nLicense Requirement Notes: 1. Sample Shipments: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons. a. Chemicals Not Eligible: A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. Mixtures: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. Compounds. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. Testing Kits: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a Description of All License Exceptions)\nLVS:\nN/A\nGBS:\nN/A\nList of Items Controlled\nRelated Controls:\nSee USML Category XIV(c) for related chemicals “subject to the ITAR” (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).\nRelated Definitions:\nSee § 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonyms for the chemicals listed in this entry.\nItems:\na.

Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. Testing Kits: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a Description of All License Exceptions)\nLVS:\nN/A\nGBS:\nN/A\nList of Items Controlled\nRelated Controls:\nSee USML Category XIV(c) for related chemicals “subject to the ITAR” (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).\nRelated Definitions:\nSee § 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonyms for the chemicals listed in this entry.\nItems:\na.

Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.\ne. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”\n2. MIXTURES:\na. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.\nb. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.\n3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\n4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3.

Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.\ne. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”\n2. MIXTURES:\na. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.\nb. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.\n3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\n4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3.

Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.\ne. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”\n2. MIXTURES:\na. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.\nb. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use.

No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.\n3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\n4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3.

A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons.\na. Chemicals Not Eligible:\nA. [Reserved]\nB. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license.\nb. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license.\nc. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements).\nd. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.\ne. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”\n2. MIXTURES:\na. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.\nb. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.\n3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\n4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number.

A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons.\na. Chemicals Not Eligible:\nA. [Reserved]\nB. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license.\nb. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license.\nc. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements).\nd. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.\ne. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”\n2. MIXTURES:\na. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.\nb. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.\n3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\n4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number.

A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons.\na. Chemicals Not Eligible:\nA. [Reserved]\nB. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license.\nb. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license.\nc. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements).\nd. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.\ne. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”\n2. MIXTURES:\na. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.\nb. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.\n3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\n4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number.

Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.\ne. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”\n2. MIXTURES:\na. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.\nb. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.\n3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\n4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number.

A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons.\na. Chemicals Not Eligible:\nA. [Reserved]\nB. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license.\nb. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license.\nc. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements).\nd. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.\ne. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”\n2. MIXTURES:\na. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.\nb. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.\n3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\n4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number.

Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR.\ne. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave., NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.”\n2. MIXTURES:\na. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs.\nb. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\nNote to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents.\n3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR.\n4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number.

See part 746 of the EAR for additional information on sanctions that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria.)\nLicense Requirement Notes 1. SAMPLE SHIPMENTS: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons. a. Chemicals Not Eligible A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. MIXTURES: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. Note to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates, isotopically-labeled forms or all possible stereoisomers) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a Description of All License Exceptions)\nLVS:\nN/A\nGBS:\nN/A\nList of Items Controlled\nRelated Controls:\nSee USML Category XIV for related chemical agent binary precursors and key precursors “subject to the ITAR” (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).\nRelated Definitions:\nSee § 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonyms for the chemicals listed in this entry.\nItems:\na.

See part 746 of the EAR for additional information on sanctions that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria.)\nLicense Requirement Notes 1. SAMPLE SHIPMENTS: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons. a. Chemicals Not Eligible A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. MIXTURES: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. Note to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates, isotopically-labeled forms or all possible stereoisomers) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a Description of All License Exceptions)\nLVS:\nN/A\nGBS:\nN/A\nList of Items Controlled\nRelated Controls:\nSee USML Category XIV for related chemical agent binary precursors and key precursors “subject to the ITAR” (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).\nRelated Definitions:\nSee § 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonyms for the chemicals listed in this entry.\nItems:\na.

The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. MIXTURES: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. Note to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates, isotopically-labeled forms or all possible stereoisomers) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature. However, CAS numbers cannot be used as unique identifiers in all situations because some forms of the listed precursor chemical have different CAS numbers, and mixtures containing a precursor chemical listed in ECCN 1C350 may also have different CAS numbers.\nList Based License Exceptions (See Part 740 for a Description of All License Exceptions)\nLVS:\nN/A\nGBS:\nN/A\nList of Items Controlled\nRelated Controls:\nSee USML Category XIV for related chemical agent binary precursors and key precursors “subject to the ITAR” (see 22 CFR parts 120 through 130).\nRelated Definitions:\nSee § 770.2(k) of the EAR for synonyms for the chemicals listed in this entry.\nItems:\na.

Chemicals Not Eligible A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. MIXTURES: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. Note to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)",

See part 746 of the EAR for additional information on sanctions that apply to Iran, North Korea, and Syria.)\nLicense Requirement Notes 1. SAMPLE SHIPMENTS: Subject to the following requirements and restrictions, a license is not required for sample shipments when the cumulative total of these shipments does not exceed a 55-gallon container or 200 kg of a single chemical to any one consignee during a calendar year. A consignee that receives a sample shipment under this exclusion may not resell, transfer, or reexport the sample shipment, but may use the sample shipment for any other legal purpose unrelated to chemical weapons. a. Chemicals Not Eligible A. [Reserved] B. CWC Schedule 2 chemicals (States not Party to the CWC). No CWC Schedule 2 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.b is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license. b. Countries Not Eligible: Countries in Country Group E:1 of Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR are not eligible to receive sample shipments of any chemicals controlled by this ECCN without a license. c. Sample shipments that require an End-Use Certificate for CW reasons: No CWC Schedule 3 chemical or mixture identified in 1C350.c is eligible for sample shipment to States not Party to the CWC (destinations not listed in Supplement No. 2 to part 745 of the EAR) without a license, unless an End-Use Certificate issued by the government of the importing country is obtained by the exporter prior to export (see § 745.2 of the EAR for End-Use Certificate requirements). d. Sample shipments that require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR: Sample shipments, as described in this Note 1, may require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. See, in particular, the end-use/end-user restrictions in part 744 of the EAR, and the restrictions that apply to embargoed countries in part 746 of the EAR. e. Annual report requirement. The exporter is required to submit an annual written report for shipments of samples made under this Note 1. The report must be on company letterhead stationery (titled “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors” at the top of the first page) and identify the chemical(s), Chemical Abstract Service Registry (C.A.S.) number(s), quantity(ies), the ultimate consignee's name and address, and the date of export for all sample shipments that were made during the previous calendar year. The report must be submitted no later than February 28 of the year following the calendar year in which the sample shipments were made, to: U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Room 2099B, Washington, DC 20230, Attn: “Report of Sample Shipments of Chemical Precursors.” 2. MIXTURES: a. Mixtures that contain precursor chemicals identified in ECCN 1C350, in concentrations that are below the levels indicated in 1C350.b, 1C350.c, 1C350.d, are controlled by ECCN 1C395 or 1C995 and are subject to the licensing requirements specified in those ECCNs. b. A license is not required under this ECCN for a mixture, when the controlled chemical in the mixture is a normal ingredient in consumer goods packaged for retail sale for personal use. Such consumer goods are designated EAR99. However, a license may be required for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. Note to Mixtures: Calculation of concentrations of AG-controlled chemicals: a. Exclusion. No chemical may be added to the mixture (solution) for the sole purpose of circumventing the Export Administration Regulations; b. Percent Weight Calculation. When calculating the percentage, by weight, of ingredients in a chemical mixture, include all ingredients of the mixture, including those that act as solvents. 3. COMPOUNDS. Compounds created with any chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350 may be shipped NLR (No License Required), without obtaining an End-Use Certificate, unless those compounds are also identified in this entry or require a license for reasons set forth elsewhere in the EAR. 4. TESTING KITS: Certain medical, analytical, diagnostic, and food testing kits containing small quantities of chemicals identified in this ECCN 1C350, are excluded from the scope of this ECCN and are controlled under ECCN 1C395 or 1C995. (Note that replacement reagents for such kits are controlled by this ECCN 1C350 if the reagents contain one or more of the precursor chemicals identified in 1C350 in concentrations equal to or greater than the control levels for mixtures indicated in 1C350.)\nTechnical Notes: 1. For purposes of this entry, a “mixture” is defined as a solid, liquid or gaseous product made up of two or more ingredients that do not react together under normal storage conditions. 2. The scope of this control applicable to Hydrogen Fluoride (see 1C350.d.14 in the List of Items Controlled) includes its liquid, gaseous, and aqueous phases, and hydrates. 3. Precursor chemicals in ECCN 1C350 are listed by name, Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number and CWC Schedule (where applicable). Precursor chemicals of the same structural formula (e.g., hydrates, isotopically-labeled forms or all possible stereoisomers) are controlled by ECCN 1C350, regardless of name or CAS number. CAS numbers are shown to assist in identifying whether a particular precursor chemical or mixture is controlled under ECCN 1C350, irrespective of nomenclature.
