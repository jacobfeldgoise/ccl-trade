An aerosol consists of particulate or liquids other than fuel components, by—products or additives, as part of the “payload” to be dispersed in the atmosphere. Examples of aerosols include pesticides for crop dusting and dry chemicals for cloud seeding. 2. An aerosol dispensing system/mechanism contains all above devices (mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, etc.), which are necessary for storage and dispersion of an aerosol into the atmosphere. This includes the possibility of aerosol injection into the combustion exhaust vapor and into the propeller slip stream.",
