'In-process monitoring', also known as in-situ process monitoring, pertains to the observation and measurement of the additive manufacturing process including electromagnetic, or thermal, emissions from the melt pool. 2. 'Co-axial configuration', also known as on-axis or inline configuration, pertains to one or more sensors that are mounted in an optical path shared by the “laser” consolidation source. 3. 'Paraxial configuration' pertains to one or more sensors that are physically mounted onto or integrated into the “laser”, electron beam, or electric arc consolidation source component. 4. For both 'co-axial configuration' and 'paraxial configuration', the field of view of the sensor(s) is fixed to the moving reference frame of the consolidation source and moves in the same scan trajectories of the consolidation source throughout the build process.",

A closed loop control system designed to modify the consolidation source parameters, build path, or equipment settings during the build cycle in response to feedback from 'in-process monitoring' equipment specified in 2B010.c.\nTechnical Notes: For the purposes of 2B910: 1. 'In-process monitoring', also known as in-situ process monitoring, pertains to the observation and measurement of the additive manufacturing process including electromagnetic, or thermal, emissions from the melt pool. 2. 'Co-axial configuration', also known as on-axis or inline configuration, pertains to one or more sensors that are mounted in an optical path shared by the “laser” consolidation source. 3. 'Paraxial configuration' pertains to one or more sensors that are physically mounted onto or integrated into the “laser”, electron beam, or electric arc consolidation source component. 4. For both 'co-axial configuration' and 'paraxial configuration', the field of view of the sensor(s) is fixed to the moving reference frame of the consolidation source and moves in the same scan trajectories of the consolidation source throughout the build process.",

A closed loop control system designed to modify the consolidation source parameters, build path, or equipment settings during the build cycle in response to feedback from 'in-process monitoring' equipment specified in 2B910.c.\nTechnical Notes: For the purposes of 2B910: 1. 'In-process monitoring', also known as in-situ process monitoring, pertains to the observation and measurement of the additive manufacturing process including electromagnetic, or thermal, emissions from the melt pool. 2. 'Co-axial configuration', also known as on-axis or inline configuration, pertains to one or more sensors that are mounted in an optical path shared by the “laser” consolidation source. 3. 'Paraxial configuration' pertains to one or more sensors that are physically mounted onto or integrated into the “laser”, electron beam, or electric arc consolidation source component. 4. For both 'co-axial configuration' and 'paraxial configuration', the field of view of the sensor(s) is fixed to the moving reference frame of the consolidation source and moves in the same scan trajectories of the consolidation source throughout the build process.",
