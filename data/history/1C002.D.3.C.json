'Melt spinning' is a process to 'solidify rapidly' a molten metal stream impinging upon a rotating chilled block, forming a flake, ribbon or rod-like product. 6. 'Comminution' is a process to reduce a material to particles by crushing or grinding. 7. 'Melt extraction' is a process to 'solidify rapidly' and extract a ribbon-like alloy product by the insertion of a short segment of a rotating chilled block into a bath of a molten metal alloy. 8. 'Mechanical alloying' is an alloying process resulting from the bonding, fracturing and rebonding of elemental and master alloy powders by mechanical impact. Non-metallic particles may be incorporated in the alloy by addition of the appropriate powders. 9. 'Plasma atomisation' is a process to reduce a molten stream or solid metal to droplets of 500 µm diameter or less, using plasma torches in an inert gas environment. 10. 'Solidify rapidly' is a process involving the solidification of molten material at cooling rates exceeding 1000 K/sec.",
