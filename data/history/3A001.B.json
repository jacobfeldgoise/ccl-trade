For purposes of 3A001.b, the parameter peak saturated power output may also be referred to on product data sheets as output power, saturated power output, maximum power output, peak power output, or peak envelope power output.\n2. For purposes of 3A001.b.1, 'vacuum electronic devices' are electronic devices based on the interaction of an electron beam with an electromagnetic wave propagating in a vacuum circuit or interacting with radio-frequency vacuum cavity resonators. 'Vacuum electronic devices' include klystrons, traveling-wave tubes, and their derivatives.\nNote 1: 3A001.b.1 does not control 'vacuum electronic devices' designed or rated for operation in any frequency band and having all of the following: a. Does not exceed 31.8 GHz; and b. Is “allocated by the ITU” for radio-communications services, but not for radio-determination.\nNote 2: 3A001.b.1 does not control non-”space-qualified” 'vacuum electronic devices' having all the following: a. An average output power equal to or less than 50 W; and b. Designed or rated for operation in any frequency band and having all of the following: 1. Exceeds 31.8 GHz but does not exceed 43.5 GHz; and 2. Is “allocated by the ITU” for radio-communications services, but not for radio-determination.\nNote 2: The control status of the “MMIC” whose rated operating frequency includes frequencies listed in more than one frequency range, as defined by 3A001.b.2.a through 3A001.b.2.h, is determined by the lowest peak saturated power output control threshold.\nNote 3: Notes 1 and 2 following the Category 3 heading for product group A. Systems, Equipment, and Components mean that 3A001.b.2 does not control “MMICs” if they are “specially designed” for other applications, e.g., telecommunications, radar, automobiles.\nNote 1: The control status of a transistor in 3A001.b.3.a through 3A001.b.3.e, whose rated operating frequency includes frequencies listed in more than one frequency range, as defined by 3A001.b.3.a through 3A001.b.3.e, is determined by the lowest peak saturated power output control threshold.\nNote 2: 3A001.b.3 includes bare dice, dice mounted on carriers, or dice mounted in packages. Some discrete transistors may also be referred to as power amplifiers, but the status of these discrete transistors is determined by 3A001.b.3.\nNote 2: The control status of an item whose rated operating frequency includes frequencies listed in more than one frequency range, as defined by 3A001.b.4.a through 3A001.b.4.e, is determined by the lowest peak saturated power output control threshold.\nNote: 3A001.b.8 does not control equipment designed or rated for operation in any frequency band which is “allocated by the ITU” for radio-communications services, but not for radio-determination.\nTechnical Note: In 3A001.b.10, F is the offset from the operating frequency in Hz and f is the operating frequency in MHz.\n'Vacuum electronic devices' and cathodes, as follows:\nb.1.

For purposes of 3A001.b, the parameter peak saturated power output may also be referred to on product data sheets as output power, saturated power output, maximum power output, peak power output, or peak envelope power output.\n2. For purposes of 3A001.b.1, 'vacuum electronic devices' are electronic devices based on the interaction of an electron beam with an electromagnetic wave propagating in a vacuum circuit or interacting with radio-frequency vacuum cavity resonators. 'Vacuum electronic devices' include klystrons, traveling-wave tubes, and their derivatives.\nNote 1: 3A001.b.1 does not control 'vacuum electronic devices' designed or rated for operation in any frequency band and having all of the following: a. Does not exceed 31.8 GHz; and b. Is “allocated by the ITU” for radio-communications services, but not for radio-determination.\nNote 2: 3A001.b.1 does not control non-”space-qualified” 'vacuum electronic devices' having all the following: a. An average output power equal to or less than 50 W; and b. Designed or rated for operation in any frequency band and having all of the following: 1. Exceeds 31.8 GHz but does not exceed 43.5 GHz; and 2. Is “allocated by the ITU” for radio-communications services, but not for radio-determination.\nNote 2: The control status of the “MMIC” whose rated operating frequency includes frequencies listed in more than one frequency range, as defined by 3A001.b.2.a through 3A001.b.2.h, is determined by the lowest peak saturated power output control threshold.\nNote 3: Notes 1 and 2 following the Category 3 heading for product group A. Systems, Equipment, and Components mean that 3A001.b.2 does not control “MMICs” if they are “specially designed” for other applications, e.g., telecommunications, radar, automobiles.\nNote 1: The control status of a transistor in 3A001.b.3.a through 3A001.b.3.e, whose rated operating frequency includes frequencies listed in more than one frequency range, as defined by 3A001.b.3.a through 3A001.b.3.e, is determined by the lowest peak saturated power output control threshold.\nNote 2: 3A001.b.3 includes bare dice, dice mounted on carriers, or dice mounted in packages. Some discrete transistors may also be referred to as power amplifiers, but the status of these discrete transistors is determined by 3A001.b.3.\nNote 2: The control status of an item whose rated operating frequency includes frequencies listed in more than one frequency range, as defined by 3A001.b.4.a through 3A001.b.4.e, is determined by the lowest peak saturated power output control threshold.\nNote: 3A001.b.8 does not control equipment designed or rated for operation in any frequency band which is “allocated by the ITU” for radio-communications services, but not for radio-determination.\nTechnical Note: In 3A001.b.10, F is the offset from the operating frequency in Hz and f is the operating frequency in MHz.\n'Vacuum electronic devices' and cathodes, as follows:\nb.1.

A 'transmit/receive MMIC' is a multifunction “MMIC” that provides bi-directional amplitude and phase control for transmission and reception of signals.\n4. A 'transmit MMIC' is a “MMIC” that provides amplitude and phase control for transmission of signals.\n5. 2.7 GHz should be used as the lowest operating frequency (fGHz) in the formula in 3A001.b.12.c for transmit/receive or transmit modules that have a rated operation range extending downward to 2.7 GHz and below [d≤15cm*GHz*N/2.7 GHz].\n6. 3A001.b.12 applies to 'transmit/receive modules' or 'transmit modules' with or without a heat sink. The value of d in 3A001.b.12.c does not include any portion of the 'transmit/receive module' or 'transmit module' that functions as a heat sink.\n7. 'Transmit/receive modules' or 'transmit modules,' 'transmit/receive MMICs' or 'transmit MMICs' may or may not have N integrated radiating antenna elements where N is the number of transmit or transmit/receive channels.",

A 'transmit/receive MMIC' is a multifunction “MMIC” that provides bi-directional amplitude and phase control for transmission and reception of signals.\n4. A 'transmit MMIC' is a “MMIC” that provides amplitude and phase control for transmission of signals.\n5. 2.7 GHz should be used as the lowest operating frequency (fGHz) in the formula in 3A001.b.12.c for transmit/receive or transmit modules that have a rated operation range extending downward to 2.7 GHz and below [d≤15cm*GHz*N/2.7 GHz].\n6. 3A001.b.12 applies to 'transmit/receive modules' or 'transmit modules' with or without a heat sink. The value of d in 3A001.b.12.c does not include any portion of the 'transmit/receive module' or 'transmit module' that functions as a heat sink.\n7. 'Transmit/receive modules' or 'transmit modules,' 'transmit/receive MMICs' or 'transmit MMICs' may or may not have N integrated radiating antenna elements where N is the number of transmit or transmit/receive channels.",
