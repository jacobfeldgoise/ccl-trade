'Real-time bandwidth' is the widest frequency range for which the analyzer can continuously transform time-domain data entirely into frequency-domain results, using a Fourier or other discrete time transform that processes every incoming time point, without a reduction of measured amplitude of more than 3 dB below the actual signal amplitude caused by gaps or windowing effects, while outputting or displaying the transformed data. 2.

A 'frequency mask trigger' is a mechanism where the trigger function is able to select a frequency range to be triggered on as a subset of the acquisition bandwidth while ignoring other signals that may also be present within the same acquisition bandwidth. A 'frequency mask trigger' may contain more than one independent set of limits.\nNote: 3A002.c.4 does not apply to those “signal analyzers” using only constant percentage bandwidth filters (also known as octave or fractional octave filters).",
